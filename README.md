# Address_Book
<!-- Read these instructions and understand the requirements FIRST
Whiteboard your app
Make a code plan
Pseudo code and then translate to JavaScript
Create a new repo (name it descriptively well), clone it to your local machine and share it with your partner
Open the directory and create an index.html and main.js file to fetch a user and display them one at at time
Use the API: https://randomuser.me/api/ to fetch a user now -->
//Fetch a new user multiple times and store them in an array
Then list out all the users in your address book array by name and picture
//Figure out how to fetch multiple users in one fetch request
//Fetch multiple users on window load
Add a button to each user that when clicked displays the rest of their information like DOB, address and so forth
Once you have the functionality working, feel free to style and structure your address book with CSS and HTML
